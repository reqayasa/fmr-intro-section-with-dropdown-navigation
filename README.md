## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Responsive Image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

### What I learned
I using pseudo-element as much as i can to minimize empty and unecesery html tag. But it sometimes difficult to position pseudo-element i x, y, and z axis. 

The dropdown is fully css only.

I try to use Responsive Image with picture and srcset to automaticaly change image depend on screen size using only css. Its easy and work excelent.
